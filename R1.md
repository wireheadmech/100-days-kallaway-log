## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - beginning November 2018

### Day 1: November 25 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**

Spent time building the initial HTML5 format of my primary website. At the
moment, it simply points to the blog, but I want a directional and informational
site that on one hand tells the things I want known about myself as well as
directs the viewer to the various sites and servers I have set up. I have
also learned how to connect font awesome to the site.

**Thoughts:**

Feels good to be back at coding.

Site is not live yet.

### Day 2: November 26 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**

Still working on the new website getting the structure together. Got a skeleton
together and got it to serve on Chrome. Firefox not so much.

**Thoughts:**

Irritated and frustrated. But tomorrow will bring me more of a good
chance to understand how this is all supposed to go together and get the grids
right.

### Day 3: November 27 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**

I went back and started everything from scratch. I have a
better framework than I had yesterday, although it all started out a bit
frustrating. Now I am using a video by Traversy Media to help walk me through
this, then I can tweak it later.

**Thoughts:**

I feel better now that I have something to follow, although it is
showing me some of the possible holes in FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 4: November 28 Wednesday

 **Today's Progress:**

 I finally have the quad section in! It is a rather big
 deal for me, as I was not able to get this to work for life, love, or money
 before. I am also trying to get more of my work shifted to *Tintern*, which is
 my HP Fedora 29 based laptop.

 **Thoughts:**

 This way of thinking is now beginning to take hold in my normal job and I am
 shifting my viewpoints to thinking more in code than the typical server admin
 thought. It is helping me analyze things. I have also discovered that for some
 reason Atom will not allow me to write in anything other than American English.
 Whatever.

### Day 5: November 29 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**

I was able to create the other two pages for the website, and I also was able
to spin up two new servers for a coming project. Of course, I also had to name
them after the two AI entities in Neuromancer.

**Thoughts:**

Very excited that I am getting things done, and I am beginning to see the added
results in my daily work as I am looking at problems and issues that arise from
a more code-related perspective.

**Today's Progress:**

Fighting. Fighting. Fighting.

**Thoughts:**

Trying to build things.

### Day 7: December 1 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**

I made a decision about my laptop today, and that has taken some of my time. I
spent part of my time fighting with the laptop and trying to decide the final
disposition of it. Eventually I realised that maybe I should be putting my skills
to work instead of whining about the operating system.

**Thoughts:**

I can totally do this and make this laptop what I want it to be, with all of the
bells and whistles. It should no longer interrupt my coding, but should enhance
it.

### Day 8: December 3 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**

Further progress in getting **reitoei** set up properly. A lot of this has had
to incorporate learning configuration files as well as loading certain packages
to handle things like sound and beautification. It also has been a learning
process to get things like sound adjustment and getting more cli controls under
my belt.

**Thoughts:**

I am beginning to feel much better about all of this, and I fully realise that I
will have to get the laptop to a better state than my MacBook that belongs to my
employer. And I will be applying myself towards that for the next week as I
continue to progress across the board. All of these different things will allow
me to code things in the future that I would like to see on my system and use for
myself.

### Day 9: December 4 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**

I am beginning to get more in my head again about how the certain systems are
all laid out. While some of this programming has been web related and more for
the outside esoteric thing, I am really into it for the system programming. I
have created the beginnings of Rei, and I want her to be able to give me all of
the performance and edge that I am going to need. This is becoming an incredible
advancement in my technical evolution.

**Thoughts:**

All I want to do now is code. Create. Build. And enjoy it all in the process. My
wife keeps joking that Rei is my technology "mistress", and so I have to watch
my family time so it doesn't become necessarily true.

Not yet, but soon.

### Day 10: December 5 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**

I have begun to find clearer direction to what I am seeking to do, and I wrote
a snippet on my dev blog about that. I am now thinking that I want to head in a
Python3 direction with Rei, and stick with the Node.js coding with Scottie and
Draigie, who are both Discord bots.

I also discovered SoloLearn and I spent my hour learning the fundamentals of
Python 3. So I knocked one module out, and I will probably do the same tonight
on my learning system at work.

**Thoughts:**

There is really nothing I can do at this point other than head forward and learn
these coding languages in practise the best that I can and use them. I am already
beginning to feel it in my wrists, but that might be the way I am situated on
this laptop keyboard.

### Day 11: December 6 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**

Purchased a Nook and loaded it with the first iteration of books. Also spent
more time working on SoloLearn.

**Thoughts:**

Liking the possibilities that are in front of me at this point. I am also
getting to the point where if the thought / thing / process is not useful to me
at the time it is happening, I now start breaking it off and move on. That is
discussion, web surfing, social media, there is certainly a change towards only things that are actually useful. I find that I am losing patience for any time
wasters I do not fully intend to be engaged in.

### Day 13: December 8 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**

Practise in both SoloLearn and FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**


I am feeling pretty good about the progress I am making. I am learning a good
deal about Python3 as well as getting a much more clear idea of what I plan to
accomplish with the upcoming massive project.

### Day 14: December 10 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**
Began using Pomodoro to get myself scheduled. Full plotting of system processes
and mind-mapping with great progress on the python course.

**Thoughts:**

I am getting more excited to finally get so close to actually getting a paper
on something that isn't system administration or networking.
