### Day 1: November 24 2018. dydd Satwrn

**Today's Progress**: Executed Day 1 from the website.

start somewhere.

### Day 2: November 25 2018, dydd Sul

**Today's Progress**: Executed dydd 2 from the website.

**Thoughts:** Nice and easy. A good refresher. Trying to also convert the notes
in this log to Cymraeg as much as possible as I move along. By the end of this
round I hope to have all comments in Cymraeg.

**Vocabulary:**
- Welsh = Cymraeg
- Because = achos
- To love = caru

### Day 3: November 26 2018, dydd Llun

**Today's Progress**: Executed dydd 3 from the website.

**Thoughts:** Quite a few of these works I already knew and were stored in my
brain, so they were quite easy to use again. The new words I gained were ones
that I really wanted to know, so that made it so much more fulfilling.

**Vocabulary:**
- Wales = Cymru
- And = a
- Language = iaith
- The language = yr iaith

### Day 4: November 27 2018, dydd Mawrth

**Today's Progress:**
Today was quite good. And I am writing this two days later, because I apparently
forgot to do so when I was in it earlier.

**Thoughts:**
I am pleased with the immersion that I am now getting in Cymraeg. I have been
doing a lot more listening to BBC Cymru and I know deep down that I cannot
deprive my little one of her heritage. It would also be really cool to be able
to speak to my family in our native language.

**Vocabulary:**

### Day 5: November 28 2018, dydd Mercher

**Today's Progress:**
Today was the last of the daily lessons that SSiW provides, so now I am going to
have to think of something, which will most likely involve getting the full
subscriptions which I am not too broken up about.

**Thoughts:**
I will most likely get the full learning package tonight. We'll see.

### Dydd 6: November 29 2018, dydd Iau

**Today's Progress:**
Today was the recap day, and I managed to both complete it and purchase the
full subscription to the lessons.

**Thoughts:**
I am very excited to get into the lessons and progress more. I have also been
exposing myself to more media in Cymraeg.

### Dydd 7: Tachwedd 30 2018, dydd Gwener

**Today's Progress:**
Completed Level 1, Challenge 1.

**Thoughts:**
I have done this particular challenge several times, so it was really a breeze
for me. I fully expect to have a few much easier days and then things will pick
up. But since I am also immersing myself more in Cymraeg media, this should not
become quite the difficulty that I was initially expecting.

### Dydd 8: Rhagfyr 3 2018, dydd Llun

**Today's Progress:**

I was able to listen to today's lesson on my happy laptop, but not until I set
up a new music setup on the system.

**Thoughts:**

As I am going through the lesson, I am constantly speaking to my little one in
Gymraeg which helps me use it in real life situations. That also helps it to be
heard in the house, so it will all become much more easier to understand later
when it is in much more use.

### Dydd 9: Rhagfyr 4 2018, dydd Mawrth

**Today's Progress:**

I completed Lesson 3, and it is still good and necessary. I am trying to do it
more on autopilot so it will sink in subconsciously. That does seem to be working
I find that I am rattling the words out about as soon as they are presented, which
I think was the overall point.

**Thoughts**

My brain is melting. But in a fun and strange way.

Pleased but I wish I could do better.
